# cdi_model_engines
A CDI driven by 12v to be used by model engines

Its for my brother next model engine that he's building, a Hoglet.

Features:
 * Should (in theory) support a 12Cyl up to 6000 rpm
 * 2 wire hallsensor solution (like a GME)
 * Hallsensor trigger output to optional other board (like a arduino)
 * Optionally trigger from a input instead of hallsensor (remove a solder bridge)
